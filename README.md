# streaming-service-on-reach

I. Introduction:
The project is to create a decentralized music streaming platform where users can listen to music by paying with cryptocurrency. The backend developer builds the server-side infrastructure and database, the frontend developer builds the user interface and experience, and the Reach contract developer creates the smart contract that handles payment and song playback.

II. Technological Instruction:
A. Reach Contract Development:

Review Reach contract documentation
Define the contract, including interfaces and constants
Define functions required for the platform
Test the contract on Reach test network
B. Backend Development:

Choose server-side framework
Define server-side endpoints
Define database schema
Implement server-side logic
Test the backend with a testing framework
C. Frontend Development:

Choose frontend framework
Design UI/UX
Implement frontend logic
Integrate frontend with backend
Test the frontend with a testing framework
D. Integration:

Integrate Reach contract with the backend
Deploy the contract to the Algorand blockchain using the Reach CLI
Integrate Algorand SDK with the backend
This will create a platform where users can browse and play songs by paying with cryptocurrency in a decentralized manner.








Streaming Platform dApp - Technical Readme
Introduction
This streaming platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to play songs from a platform and pay for them using tokens. The platform will be built using a smart contract written in the Reach programming language, which is compiled to Ethereum and Algorand blockchains. The frontend will be built using React.js, and the backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js.

Smart Contract
The smart contract is responsible for managing the platform's songs, users, and payments. The contract is written in Reach, which is a higher-level language that is easy to learn and provides a safe development environment.

The smart contract will include the following functionality:

Add a song to the platform
Play a song from the platform
Get the details of a song
Get the user's balance
Withdraw the user's remaining balance from the smart contract
The smart contract developer will need to:

Install the Reach programming language and the Reach standard library
Write the smart contract in Reach
Compile the smart contract to the desired blockchain (Ethereum or Algorand)
Test the smart contract using the Reach testing framework
Deploy the smart contract to the blockchain
The smart contract code will be stored in a repository on GitHub, which the frontend and backend developers will access.

Backend
The backend is responsible for handling user authentication and payment processing. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, which are popular and widely used JavaScript frameworks.

The backend will include the following functionality:

Register a user
Login a user
Authenticate a user using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Handle payments using Stripe
The backend developer will need to:

Install Node.js and Express.js
Create a new Node.js project and install required dependencies
Write the backend code, including authentication and payment processing
Test the backend using Jest
Deploy the backend to a hosting platform (e.g. Heroku)
The backend code will be stored in a repository on GitHub, which the frontend developer will access.

Frontend
The frontend is responsible for providing a user interface for the streaming platform. The frontend will be built using React.js, which is a popular and widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The frontend will include the following functionality:

Sign up for a new account
Login to an existing account
Browse and play songs from the platform
Display user balance and allow for withdrawal of remaining balance
Display payment history
The frontend developer will need to:

Install React.js and required dependencies
Write the frontend code, including user authentication and payment processing
Test the frontend using Jest and/or Cypress
Deploy the frontend to a hosting platform (e.g. Netlify)
The frontend code will be stored in a repository on GitHub, which the backend developer will access.

Integration
The three components of the streaming platform (smart contract, backend, and frontend) will need to be integrated to create a seamless user experience. The following steps will need to be taken:

The smart contract will be compiled and deployed to the desired blockchain (Ethereum or Algorand)
The backend will be deployed to a hosting platform
The frontend will be deployed to a hosting platform
The frontend will make API requests to the backend to handle user authentication and payment processing
The frontend will interact with the smart contract using the Reach SDK to handle song playing, balance display, and balance withdrawal

The backend developer is responsible for building a scalable and secure server infrastructure to handle user data, song storage, and payment processing. The frontend developer is tasked with creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to search, play, and purchase songs. The contract developer needs to create a smart contract that manages the purchase and playback of songs, handles payments, and tracks user balances and song play counts.
